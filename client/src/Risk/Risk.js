    <h3 className='info ms-4 fs-3'> â­•- Setting Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Points</h3>

    <p className='info ms-4 me-4'>A stop-loss point is the price at which a trader will sell a stock and take a loss on the trade. This often happens when a trade does not pan out the way a trader hoped. The points are designed to prevent the "it will come back" mentality and limit losses before they escalate. For example, if a stock breaks below a key support level, traders often sell as soon as possible.</p>

    <p className='info ms-4 me-4'> On the other hand, a take-profit point is the price at which a trader will sell a stock and take a profit on the trade. This is when the additional upside is limited given the risks. For example, if a stock is approaching a key resistance level after a large move upward, traders may want to sell before a period of consolidation takes place.</p>

    <h3 className='info ms-4 fs-3'> â­•- How to More Effectively Set Stop-Loss Points</h3>

    <p className='info ms-4 me-4'>Setting stop-loss and take-profit points is often done using technical analysis, but fundamental analysis can also play a key role in timing. For example, if a trader is holding a stock ahead of earnings as excitement builds, they may want to sell before the news hits the market if expectations have become too high, regardless of whether the take-profit price has been hit.</p>

    <p className='info ms-4 me-4'>Moving averages represent the most popular way to set these points, as they are easy to calculate and widely tracked by the market. Key moving averages include the 5-, 9-, 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day averages. These are best set by applying them to a stock's chart and determining whether the stock price has reacted to them in the past as either a support or resistance level.</p>

    <p className='info ms-4 me-4'>Another great way to place stop-loss or take-profit levels is on support or resistance trend lines. These can be drawn by connecting previous highs or lows that occurred on significant, above-average volume. The key is determining levels at which the price reacts to the trend lines or moving averages and, of course, on high volume.</p>
